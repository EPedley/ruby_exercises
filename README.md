# ruby_exercises

I will be uploading all the exercises I complete during The Odin Project's Ruby course. 

So far I have learnt to use the following:
- Basic data types and variables
- Conditional logic
- Loops, arrays, hashes and methods
- Basic and predicated enumerable methods
- Nested collections
